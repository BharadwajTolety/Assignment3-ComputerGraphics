Drone Camera:
The drone camera is created using a scenegraph described in a XML file named 'drone_camera.xml'. We have divided the drone into 4 parts:
1. The body is a sphere
2. the 3 axes are composed of a cylinder for the body and a cone for the arrowhead.
The Drone Camera axes:
1. Blue: Right(x-axis)
2. Red: Up(y-axis)
3. Yellow: Opposite of gaze(-z direction)

Our program has the following features:\pabilities:
1. The camera moves up using the “up” arrow key.
2. The camera moves down using the “down” arrow key.
3. The camera moves left using the “left” arrow key.
4. The camera moves right using the “right” arrow key.
5. The camera turns left in its place using the “a” or “A” key.
6. The camera turns right in its place using the “d” or “D” key.
7. The camera turns up in its place using the “w” or “W” key.
8. The camera turns down in its place using the “s” or “S” key.
9. The camera tilts right in its place using the “f” or “F” key.
10. The camera tilts left in its place using the “c” or “C” key.

To load up the models for the scene and drone camera, use the file 'input_config_building.txt'. The first string is the path for loading up the model for the scene and the second path string is for loading up the model for the drone_camera.

In our team we have two different platforms, one windows and one mac. This led to a few complications as stated below:
1. The second viewport does not appear in the right-top corner of the screen in MAc as it does in Windows. We believe this is due to the differeinz sixes of the buffers OpenGL uses.
2. The drone does not show up on the Mac but does appear on the Windows system.
